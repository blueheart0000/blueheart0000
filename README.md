## 🧠 About Me

I'm a backend-focused software developer with solid experience in **Java**, **web application development**, and **system design**.  
I care about **clean code**, **scalable architecture**, and **practical solutions** that actually work in production.

I enjoy turning complex requirements into reliable systems, and I’m comfortable collaborating in **remote, cross-cultural teams**.
